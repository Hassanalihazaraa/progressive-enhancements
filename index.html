        <blockquote>
            <p class="text">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his
                neighbors came
                around to commiserate. They said, <q class="neighbours">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
                    This is most
                    unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> The next day the horse came back
                bringing
                seven wild horses with it,
                and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="neighbours">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a
                    great turn of events.
                    You
                    now
                    have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong>

                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his
                leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="neighbours">Oh dear, that’s too
                    <tag class="bad">bad</tag>
                </q> and the farmer responded,
                <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> The next day the
                conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because
                he
                had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbours">Isn’t that
                    great!</q> Again, he said,
                <strong>“Maybe.”</strong>

                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible
                to
                tell whether anything that happens in it is
                <tag class="good">good</tag>
                or
                <tag class="bad">bad</tag>
                — because you never know what will be the
                consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
                <tag class="good">good</tag>
                fortune.

            <tag class="bad">Bad</tag>

            <tag class="good">good</tag>
            for monkeys, but
            monkeys are not
            <tag class="good">good</tag>
            for bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...
